## üö® **Emergency Quick Fixes**

### My Website Is Down - Everyone Sees Error Messages

**Quick Check:**
1. **Visit your domain**: `yourdomain.com`
2. **Try the Vercel URL**: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
3. **Try the backend URL**: `https://your-backend.onrender.com`

**If Domain is Down but Vercel URL Works:**
- **Problem**: DNS/Domain issue
- **Fix**: Wait 30 minutes, then check Namecheap DNS settings
- **Urgency**: Medium (people can still use Vercel URL temporarily)

**If Everything is Down:**
- **Problem**: Major hosting issue
- **Fix**: Contact your developer immediately
- **Urgency**: High (entire app is broken)

### Users Can't Create Accounts

**Quick Test:**
1. **Go to your website**
2. **Try creating a test account**
3. **Check if you get specific error messages**

**Common Fixes:**
- **"Database connection error"**: Check Supabase is running
- **"Server error"**: Check Render backend is running
- **"Invalid credentials"**: Check environment variables

## üîç **Diagnostic Steps**

### Step 1: Check Service Status

**Vercel (Frontend):**
1. **Log into Vercel**: `vercel.com`
2. **Go to your project**
3. **Check "Deployments" tab**
4. **Look for red X's or errors**

**Render (Backend):**
1. **Log into Render**: `render.com`
2. **Go to your backend service**
3. **Check if it says "Live" (green)**
4. **Look at "Logs" for error messages**

**Supabase (Database):**
1. **Log into Supabase**: `supabase.com`
2. **Go to your project**
3. **Check if project is "Active"**
4. **Look for any warning messages**

### Step 2: Check Domain Connection

1. **Go to Namecheap domain management**
2. **Check DNS records are still there**:
   - A Record: @ ‚Üí 76.76.19.19
   - CNAME Record: www ‚Üí cname.vercel-dns.com
3. **Check domain isn't expired**

### Step 3: Test Each Part Separately

**Test 1: Frontend Only**
- Visit your Vercel URL directly
- If this works, problem is domain-related

**Test 2: Backend Only**  
- Visit your Render URL + `/health` (if you have a health endpoint)
- Should show some response, not an error

**Test 3: Database Only**
- Log into Supabase
- Go to Table Editor
- Try viewing your tables
