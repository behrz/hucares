2. **Click "Manage"** next to your domain name

3. **You're now in the domain control panel**
   - This is where we'll make changes

## üéØ **Step 3: Set Up DNS Records**

**What is DNS?** Think of it like a phone book for the internet. When someone types your domain name, DNS tells their computer where to find your website.

### Part A: Go to DNS Settings

1. **Look for a tab called "Advanced DNS"** and click it
   - It might also be called "DNS" or "DNS Management"

2. **You'll see a table with DNS records**
   - This might look confusing, but we'll add simple ones

### Part B: Add the First Record (A Record)

1. **Click "Add New Record"** (usually a button or link)

2. **Choose "A Record"** from the dropdown menu

3. **Fill in these fields exactly**:
   - **Type**: A Record (already selected)
   - **Host**: @ (just the @ symbol)
   - **Value**: `76.76.19.19` (this is Vercel's IP address)
   - **TTL**: Leave as "Automatic" or "1 min"

4. **Click "Save" or "Add Record"**

### Part C: Add the Second Record (CNAME Record)

1. **Click "Add New Record"** again

2. **Choose "CNAME Record"** from the dropdown menu

3. **Fill in these fields exactly**:
   - **Type**: CNAME Record (already selected)
   - **Host**: www
   - **Value**: `cname.vercel-dns.com`
   - **TTL**: Leave as "Automatic" or "1 min"

4. **Click "Save" or "Add Record"**

---

## üéØ **Step 4: Save Your Settings**

1. **Look for a "Save Changes" button** at the bottom of the page
   - Click it if you see one

2. **You should see a confirmation message**
   - Something like "DNS records updated successfully"

3. **Write down what you just did**:
   ```
   Domain: [your domain name]
   Date: [today's date]
   Added A Record: @ ‚Üí 76.76.19.19
   Added CNAME Record: www ‚Üí cname.vercel-dns.com
   ```

---

## üéØ **Step 5: Wait for Changes to Take Effect**

**Important**: DNS changes take time to spread across the internet.

1. **Wait 15-30 minutes** before testing
   - Changes can take up to 48 hours, but usually work within 30 minutes

2. **Don't worry if it doesn't work immediately**
   - This is completely normal

3. **You can continue with the next guide** while you wait

---

## ‚úÖ **How to Test If It's Working**

After waiting 30 minutes:

1. **Open a new browser tab**

2. **Type your domain name**: `yourdomain.com`
   - Replace "yourdomain" with your actual domain

3. **What you might see**:
   - ‚úÖ **"This site can't be reached"** or **"404 Not Found"** = DNS is working! (We haven't built the website yet)
   - ‚ùå **"DNS error"** or **"Server not found"** = Wait longer, or check your DNS settings

---

## üÜò **Troubleshooting Common Problems**

### Problem: "I don't see Advanced DNS"
**Solution**: 
- Look for "DNS", "Domain", or "Nameservers" tabs
- Some accounts show "DNS Management" instead

### Problem: "It says my domain is locked"
**Solution**:
- Look for "Domain Lock" or "Registrar Lock" settings
- Turn OFF the lock temporarily
- You can turn it back on later

### Problem: "I made a mistake in the DNS records"
**Solution**:
- Find the record you want to change
- Click "Edit" or the pencil icon
- Fix the information
- Click "Save"

### Problem: "I don't see where to add records"
**Solution**:
- Look for buttons like:
  - "Add New Record"
  - "Add Record" 
  - "+"
  - "Create Record"
